# MLB Transaction Data

This repo houses all [MLB Transaction Data](http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/transactions/) from 2001 - Current Month. This data is in structured .csv format,
with columns ```transaction``` (specifying which team did which action with which player(s)) and ```date``` (specifying the date of the given transaction).

# Issues with the Data

On several random baseball forums I've seen people complaining about the quality of this data. I'm sure this complaining is warranted. As such,
if there are mistakes or missing records, feel free to open an issue or pull request and fix this data!
